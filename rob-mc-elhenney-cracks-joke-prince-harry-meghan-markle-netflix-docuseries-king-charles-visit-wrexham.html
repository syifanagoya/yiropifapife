According to McElhenney, the King must be a supporter of the team. He said, "This is an incoming call. So we hope that he's a fan. If not, we'll make him a fan." Reynolds said he hoped to talk to the monarch about the work they were doing to improve the club and stadium. "I would love to tell him a little bit about what it is that we're hoping to achieve with the renovation of the Kop stand, and it's not even a renovation, I would say that it's a complete reimagining of the Kop stand, and what that will mean to not just the club, but the community of Wrexham as well," he reportedly said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoqp%2BXeq6vjJ6joZ2eo7K6ecKrmJyjo2K3sLfEZqeroZ6Ysm60wKupsmWdmrSprc1mpJqqm6GybrrErZ2loahisbCv1Kycq6GVqHqstc2gZJygkae5pr%2BMr6CsoaRixLOx16GYpg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
