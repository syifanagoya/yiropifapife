That makes her one of the richest people in Nevada.</p><p>Nancy Walton Laurie was born on May 15, 1951. She was raised in Versailles, Missouri. She is one of two daughters born to James "Bud" Walton.

When Sam died three years earlier in 1992, he was worth $8.6 billion.

At their ranch in Columbia they raise appaloosa horses.</p><p>Nancy have owned property in Bel-Air for over a decade, compiling a 9-10 acre property that is technically made up of around a dozen parcels. They have slowly and quietly expanded their compound. For example, in November 2017 they paid $14.6 million, nearly $5 million OVER the asking price, for a neighboring property. In the twenty years between 2001 and 2021, Nancy spent at least $60 million assembling her compound. It may be the largest individual property in Bel-Air in terms of acreage.</p><p>In January 2015 Nancy and Bill filed a lawsuit against mega-mansion developer (and father of models Bella and <a href=# title="Gigi Hadid Net Worth">Gigi Hadid</a>) <a href=# title="Mohamed Hadid Net Worth">Mohamed Hadid</a> alleging that a retaining wall he installed at a property in Bel-Air damaged roots of a eucalyptus tree on their property.

She is the President and founder of Cedar Lake Contemporary Ballet, a dance company based in New York City. She is also the owner of Columbia Performing Arts Centre in Columbia, Missouri.</p><h2 id=paige-laurie-controversies><strong>Paige Laurie Controversies</strong></h2><p>In 2001, Nancy and Bill donated $25 million to the University of Missouri to pay for the construction of a new sports arena. According to the terms of their donation, the sports arena was to be named after their daughter Paige Laurie. Interestingly, at the time of the donation Paige was actually a student at the University of Southern California. A few years after the donation, Paige was credibly accused of paying a fellow student at USC to do her homework. The student claimed that she had written term papers and done homework for the heiress for 3.5 years. In the fallout of the scandal, Paige relinquished her diploma to USC. She had previously been a 2004 recipient of a bachelor's degree by the School for Communication.</p><p>Further fallout came as the University of Missouri eventually grew concerned about the fact that its sports arena, the Paige Sports Arena, was named after a person who not only did NOT attend the school but cheated her way through a different school. Her name was eventually removed from the stadium.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6o8HSoqWeq6Oisq970aKaoZ2jqXqjtculoKimkZ6%2Fpr%2BOp5inm6lixKK406ilZqSRqr%2BqsY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
