Low-carb, high-protein diet plan is capable of bringing remarkable changes in your lives because plan not only burns fats from your body, it also reduces the release of insulin hormone.</p><p>Insulin hormone is mainly responsible for increasing the blood sugar level in your body. Exclusively chosen food items of the diet plan will bring down your blood sugar by restraining the release of insulin hormone. Besides that, the diet program will inculcate healthy eating habits in you and will boost your energy.</p><h3>Theory of Atkins Diet</h3><p>Atkins diet plan acknowledges that it’s not fatty food, which is responsible for your weight gain and other health issues because fat intake has not much to do with weight. He contends that carbs being the main culprits do havoc once they enter your body.</p><p>High carb foods such as processed foods, white flour, refined sugar, and others raise your blood sugar level. More insulin being released by your body to deal with increased blood sugar starts storing the increased sugar in the form of glycogen in liver and muscles.</p><p>However, when these stores are full and don’t have any more space left in them, insulin starts storing sugar in the form of fats in various parts of your body, which develop multiple problems such as diabetes, increased cholesterol level, and obesity. That’s the reason, insulin has also been named as <strong>fat producing hormone</strong>. Atkins diet works on simple principle of low carb foods. Low carb diet keeps insulin in control. Less insulin means reduced storage of fats, which further triggers fat burning process.</p><h3>How to Follow Atkins Diet Plan</h3><p>We cannot call Atkins diet plan simple and easy to follow. In fact, to succeed with the diet plan, you need to have strong will and firm determination because carbs and sugary foods are completely forbidden in the diet plan for minimum two weeks.</p><p>The diet plan points up the consumption of traditional food items such as red meat, eggs, bacon etc. in breakfast. These food items are rich in protein and are capable of keeping you full for longer.<span id=more-13361></span></p><h3>Relevance of Ketosis in Atkins Diet Plan</h3><p><a title="Atkins Diet Book" href=# rel=nofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Atkins diet plan</a> will take your body to ketosis. Ketosis is the stage where your body starts burning fat. Carbs being the main source of energy is vital to boost your energy. Low carb diet makes your body feel exhausted. To gain energy, your body starts breaking the stocks of fats. To reach ketosis, insulin level should be low in your body. And Atkins diet aids your body in reaching ketosis by eliminating carbs from your diet plan.</p><h3>What is Net Carb?</h3><p>Instead of keeping watch on the number of calories, the diet plan focuses on net carb. Net carb is counted by subtracting the content of fiber from the total carb content. Net carb has also been named as “digestible carb.”</p><p>For instance, total carb content of half cup of broccoli is 2.3 grams, while fiber content in it is 1.3 gram, so the net carb content of the food item is 1 gram. In this way, you can calculate the net carb content of diverse food items and can consume foods accordingly.</p><h3>Four Phases of Atkins Diet Plan</h3><p>Atkins diet plan has been divided into four phases; let’s have a look how your food items will vary in these four phases.</p><p><b>Introduction Phase</b></p><p>Phase one of the plan also known as introduction phase has duration of two weeks.

Apart from that, processed foods, grains, nuts, breads, pasta, sugary baked foods, and alcohol etc. have been considered as sinister food items and you are recommended to stay away from them.</p><p><b>Ongoing Weight Loss</b></p><p>Second phase of Atkins diet plan has been named as ongoing weight loss. In this phase, you can inculcate nutrient rich carbs such as nuts and seeds, more vegetables, berries etc. in your diet. Like phase one, you shall continue consuming natural fat and protein in the second phase also. You are supposed to go along with phase two until you lose ten pounds of weight.</p><p><b>Pre-Maintenance</b></p><p>In third phase, you can incorporate more starchy foods in your diet. You can add up to 10 grams of starchy food every week in this phase. You shall follow this phase for at least one month after losing weight.
