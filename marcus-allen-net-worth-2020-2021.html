His elder brother, Damon Allen is also a former footballer & elder sister, Michelle Allen is an actress. Initially, Marcus used to play football at Abraham Lincoln High School; then from 1978 to 1981, he played at the University of Southern California. As he joined this university in 1978, he became a member of the Trojans’ National Championship team (as a backup).</p><p>In 1979, he moved to fullback & finally, in 1980, he was the starter at tailback. In the same year, he became the third-most player in the nation to rush for 1,563 yards. After rushing for 2,342 yards in 1981, he became the second player in NCAA history to rush over 2,000 yards in one season. In his total college seasons, Marcus managed a total of 46 touchdowns & 4,664 rushing yards.</p><p>In 1986, Marcus Allen married Kathryn Edwards & in 2001, the couple got divorced due to an alleged extramarital affair on Marcus’ part.</p><h2>Age, Height, and Weight</h2><p>Being born on 26 March 1960, Marcus Allen is 64 years old as of today’s date 20th July 2024.
