Per <a href=# one-link-mark=yes>Sports Illustrated</a>, Taylor met his wife in Nebraska in 2004 when she was a graduate assistant working in media relations. Taylor said when he first caught sight of Sarah, he was surprised by how "mature" she looked. "I figured she was probably 30 years old," he told SI, noting he was 22 at the time. "As the years went by, I learned we were the same age. I would run into her more often and I realized maybe I had a chance."</p><p dir=ltr>The two eventually went on to date, but for Taylor, meeting his father-in-law was not an easy task. "The first time I met [Mike], he was upstairs in his house," he recalled to SI. "He has his XOS coaches film set up there. I was as intimidated as can be. I figured, I can impress him by watching film with him." However, things didn't go as planned, as Taylor couldn't make small talk with him and couldn't answer any football-related questions he asked, which is ironic given his position today.</p><p dir=ltr>Still, Taylor eventually got Mike's approval and <a href=#>wed Sarah in 2008</a>, when they were both working at&nbsp;Texas A&M University.&nbsp;And&nbsp;they've been expanding their family ever since.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcG5kaYJ3e9ahpmaho2LHoq%2BMrZiypJ%2BnwG7DyJ%2BcZquRp66pedKhnKulkaN8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
