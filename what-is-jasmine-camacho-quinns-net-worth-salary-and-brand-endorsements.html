Her finals time of 12.37 was sufficient to place her on top of the podium and become the Olympic&nbsp;gold medalist. That was only slightly slower than her semifinals performance of 12.26, which broke the previous Games&nbsp;record set by Australia’s Sally Pearson in 2012. She set the record of 12.35 seconds when she won gold in London nearly a decade ago. Quinn had the fastest time ever in the 100-meter hurdles in 2022 as well as winning 12 out of 13 games going into the Olympics in 2021.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-646 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The two-time Olympian was born in Charleston, South Carolina, where both of her parents were track and field athletes at Baptist College, which is now Charleston Southern University.
