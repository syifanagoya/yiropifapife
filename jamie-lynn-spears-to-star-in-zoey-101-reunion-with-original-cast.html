He has since been accused of misconduct and&nbsp;<a href=#>“sexualizing” teens</a>&nbsp;in that role.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">He said in 2021</a>&nbsp;that if some people found him difficult to work with, it was because he has “high standards. I’m very willing to defend creative things that I believe in.”</p><p>He added: “I couldn’t, and I wouldn’t have the long-term friendships and continued loyalty from so many reputable people if I’d mistreated my actors of any age, especially minors.”</p><p>A Paramount+ rep told The Post Schneider isn’t involved in the new project.</p><p><a href=#>Golden Globe winner Austin Butler,</a> who appeared on several “Zoey” episodes, won’t be participating either. Neither will Alexa Nikolas, who has spoken out about her “traumatizing” career as a child actor, including <a href=#>an incident with Jamie’s sister, Britney Spears</a>.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Spears is shown on the set of “Zoey 102” as production gets underway in North Carolina. <span class=credit>Nickelodeon Group</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">“Zoey 102” is a working title for the “Zoey 101” reunion. <span class=credit>DANA HAWLEY/PARAMOUNT+</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Spears attends the “Special Forces: The Ultimate Test” Los Angeles premiere on Dec. 13, 2022. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>Nikolas claimed that the “Piece of Me” singer started yelling at her — Nikolas and Jamie Lynn had accused each other of bullying — as Jamie Lynn hid in the back of the room.</p><p>“She has apologized to me personally,” Nikolas said of Britney last year. “Actually, Britney Spears apologized, but Nickelodeon hasn’t.
