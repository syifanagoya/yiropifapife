Albeit the clip is from Season 5, Episode 10 of The Graham Norton Show which aired 25 January 2002.</p><p>The top comment under the video comes from a user called Freda who wrote: “Look at his original face.” The remark received over 11,300 likes and similar comments followed. As another fan penned: “how has Simon changed so much but Graham didn’t age at all.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"><a title=@katiewaisselofficial href=#>@katiewaisselofficial</a><p>‘…..there used to be this fantastic scam…’ – Simon Cowell, Triangle Player – I wonder what <a title=musiciansunion href=#>#musiciansunion</a> @prsformusic and all unknowing songwriters & performers think of this…. <a title=changeiscoming href=#>#changeiscoming</a> <a title=journeyforjustice href=#>#journeyforjustice</a> <a title=fantasticacam href=#>#fantasticacam</a> <a title=musiciansrights href=#>#musiciansrights</a> <a title=safeguarding href=#>#safeguarding</a> <a title=corruption href=#>#corruption</a> <a title=humanrights href=#>#humanrights</a> <a title=creativerights href=#>#creativerights</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=legitimacy href=#>#legitimacy</a> <a title=creativeindustry href=#>#creativeindustry</a> <a title=musicindustry href=#>#musicindustry</a> <a title=qotd href=#>#qotd</a> <a title=replay href=#>#replay</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Katie Waissel" href=#>♬ original sound – Katie Waissel</a></figure>View TikTok<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-simon-cowell-fans-obsess-over-old-clip-showing-his-original-face-1>Simon Cowell fans obsess over old clip showing his ‘original face’</h2><p>At this year’s pre-recorded Royal Variety performance on December 2 viewers couldn’t take their eyes off Simon Cowell and decided to take to social media to comment on the fact.</p><p>As Cowell introduced Britain’s Got Talent Winner Axel Blake at London’s Royal Albert Hall, many noted his extremely smooth-looking face. A couple of days later, Cowell appeared on the ITV chat show Loose Women where he spoke of his eight-year-old son Eric. Many think Cowell’s face looked different in the clip, with many others claiming it was just the way the shade was hitting his face.</p><p>This has led internet users to think up a bizarre conspiracy theory that he has been replaced by a “lookalike.” Some have suggested his ever-changing appearance could be down to plastic surgery. However, Simon dissolved his facial fillers and stopped with Botox earlier this year.</p><p>Simon previously described botox as being “no more unusual than toothpaste” as per Glamour via <a href=# rel=nofollow>The Mirror</a>. However, there came a point where Simon confessed that even he didn’t recognize himself anymore.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by BBC The One Show (@bbctheoneshow)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-simon-cowell-undergoes-weight-transformation>Simon Cowell undergoes weight transformation</h2><p>There came a point where Simon realized enough was enough. Cowell told <a href=# rel=nofollow>The Sun</a> of his plastic surgery journey: “There was a stage where I might have gone a bit too far. I saw a picture of me from ‘before’ the other day, and didn’t recognize it as me first of all.”</p><p>In 2019, as Simon was coming up to his 60th birthday, the business mogul <a href=# rel=nofollow>admitted</a> to having a “21st-century facelift” and “too much Botox.” However, after being unhappy with the results he has decided to not touch his face since.</p><p>Instead, Cowell has made changes to his appearance by losing over four stone (60lbs), as he revealed in an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Sun.</a> He explained the main change he made was cutting out eating red meat. He recalled: “All I do is avoid just red meat – white meat is fine – and I eat loads of vegetables, salads and drink this great beer.</p><p>“If you’re on a diet you have to keep the food sensible, but it’s got to be interesting and tasty, then the diet’s surprisingly easy.”</p><p><strong>AND GET FREAKY WITH US ON </strong><a href=# rel=nofollow>INSTAGRAM</a><strong>, </strong><a href=# rel=nofollow>FACEBOOK</a>, <a href=# rel=nofollow>TWITTER</a> AND <a href=# rel=nofollow>TIKTOK</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfmLKtscGroK2xXaOyuL%2BOrKCmp55isLDDxKWjZp6Ro8Buu8GsnKyrXaTDpr6MqKOdZZOhtrF50qGmsKGenHqptdJmpquhl567oriMn5icnV2ku27AwKWiZquYpMQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
