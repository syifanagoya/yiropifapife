The streamer vented her frustrations to her audience, saying it shouldn’t be part of her job to put up with this type of content, nor pay money to have it taken down.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=184 data-current-count=512 data-injectable=true>The streamer then went on to announce her intention to sue the creator of the website which is distributing the images.&nbsp;Her brief, but full broadcast on the matter <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">can be viewed here</a>.</p><p data-characters=215 data-current-count=215 data-injectable=false>QTCinderella also called out Atrioc for bringing the website to the attention of the masses, as well as those that are okay with digging through the internet to find these images, calling them a part of the problem:</p><p>“If you are able to look at women who are not selling themselves or benefiting off of being seen sexually. They’re not benefitting. They’re not selling it. They’re not platforming it themselves. If you are able to look at that, then you are the problem. You see women as an object. You should not be okay doing that.”</p><p data-characters=186 data-current-count=186 data-injectable=false>The streamer also took to Twitter to call out journalists for reporting on the matter insensitively, by way of advertising the website and driving more people to the problematic images.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=486 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>I want to scream.<br>Stop.<br>Everybody fucking stop.
