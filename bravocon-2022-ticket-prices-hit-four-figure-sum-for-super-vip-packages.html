However, you might want to prepare for the high prices.</p><p>A 1-day pass to the convention costs $170 on general admission. The VIP ‚ÄòBravoholic‚Äô package costs $350 for a 1-day pass.</p><p>Those looking to secure a 3-day pass for the entire weekend will be paying much more. The ‚ÄòBravo Fan‚Äô general admission tickets for a 3-day pass costs $430. The VIP package costs $825 and there is even a SVIP ‚ÄòFuture Bravoleb‚Äô package which comes in at $1,950. Ouch.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2022/09/Screenshot-2022-09-19-at-09.55.30.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-s-included-with-bravocon-s-tickets>What‚Äôs included with BravoCon‚Äôs tickets?</h2><p>There‚Äôs a reason that the ‚ÄòFuture Bravoleb‚Äô 3-day ticket comes in at an eye-watering sum, as the ticket includes a number of perks at the event. Not only do you secure access to all three days of BravoCon but it gives you premium seating, photo ops, fast lane access, a special Bravo Bazaar shopping experience, meet and greets, access to a taping of Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen of your choice, and access to WWHL Presents: Andy‚Äôs Legends Ball at Manhattan Center. So, there‚Äôs a reason the ticket price comes in at four figures! The ticket also offers you access to an SVIP hospitality lunge and access to 12 months of Peacock Premium.</p><p>While the general admission tickets might not have as many treats as the SVIP packages, there are still plenty of activities and opportunities to take part in. The general admission tickets give you access to all the panels, programs and shows at the event, as well as photo ops, access to the Bravo Bazaar shopping experience, as well as access to the themed bars.</p><p>Sign us up!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2022/09/Screenshot-2022-09-19-at-09.53.22-1024x469.jpg><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>GET FREAKY WITH US ON&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">INSTAGRAM</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FACEBOOK</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TWITTER</a>&nbsp;AND&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TIKTOK</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfl7%2Biws5omauZpqSwsLqMa2dral2ptqS3xK1kqaqZmLK0eceiq2aen6q%2FbrLIoKyrnV2owq55xaipZqulpbKzedWip2aokZi4orPErA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
