It appears that the incident was actually captured on camera.</p><p>CM Punk and Jack Perry had quite an incident at AEW All In, and that reportedly killed morale in the company.<a href=#>&nbsp;Tony Khan was almost victim</a>&nbsp;of this situation as well, and things were not pretty at all.</p><p>Sean Sapp noted behind Fightful’s paywall that there is footage of CM Punk and Jungle Boy Jack Perry’s backstage skirmish. Cameras were all over backstage at All In documenting the event, and they captured that as well.</p><p>We’re told there is footage of the incident, as there are cameras all over Wembley.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition we have learned that Punk and Tony Khan had an interaction that was described as “contentious,” but little context was provided.</p><p>For those still holding out hope, or tin foil hat-ting, this is not a work. As with anything in wrestling, it can certainly be turned into one down the line.&nbsp;</p><p>It was noted that Miro and CM Punk have communicated with<a href=#> each other since they had their little argument backstage at All In.</a> That being said, CM Punk is not 100% okay with the whole locker room.</p><p>However, in the days prior, AEW did in fact launch the investigation into the CM Punk and Jack Perry’s altercation. We’ve been told that they have been collecting statements and interviews about the nature of what happened.</p><p>We will have to see if AEW ever releases footage of CM Punk and Jack Perry’s little fight. If anything, that footage could certainly go viral in a big way.</p><p>We will keep our eyes peeled for more updates on this story, and so many more, right here at<a href=#> Ringside News</a>.
