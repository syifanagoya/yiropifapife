A cringey word to me is ‘moist.’ I hate the word ‘moist.’ And I hate the word ‘horchata,’” the Grammy winner, 27, said on Australia’s <a href=#>The Kyle & Jackie O Show</a> on Monday, August 24. “It’s like a Mexican drink that is made out of, like, brown sugar or something. I don’t even know what the hell they put in it, but it’s really good, but I just hate that word.”</p><p>Cardi and <a href=#><strong>Megan Thee Stallion</strong></a> shocked the world on August 7 when they <a href=#>released their “WAP” music video</a>. Since then, the song, which has close to 50 curse words in it, has hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and gone viral on TikTok.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Cardi-B-Reveals-the-3-Words-Youll-Never-Hear-Her-Rap-2.jpg><p>The Love & Hip Hop: New York alum explained during Monday’s interview that she hates the clean version of the track — which changes the lyrics from “wet ass p–sy” to “wet and gushy” — but she thinks it is better than another option she had initially considered for radio.</p><p>“I would’ve had to replace it with ‘Now from the top, make it drop / Bounce that big ol’ booty’ because that was the only thing that rhymed,” she said. “It was really hard for me to clean this song up ‘cause nobody could’ve convinced me to keep ‘gushy’ ‘cause I hate the word ‘gushy.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Cardi-B-Reveals-the-3-Words-Youll-Never-Hear-Her-Rap.jpg><p>To celebrate her first single in nine months, Cardi invited <a href=#><strong>Kylie Jenner</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Normani</strong></a>, <strong>Rosalía</strong>, <strong>Mulatto</strong> and <strong>Rubi Rose</strong> to star in the “WAP” music video.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I feel like people be wanting to put female artists against each other,” she told <strong>Zane Lowe</strong> on Apple Music’s New Music Daily after releasing the song. “Every single time I feel like there’s a female artist that’s coming up, coming up, coming up and getting [their] mainstream moment, I always see little, slick comments like, ‘Oh, they taking over your spot. They taking over this, they taking over that.’ And it just makes me feel like, ‘Damn, why it had to be like that?’ Because I actually like shorty’s music a lot.”</p><p>The wordsmith explained that having a powerful female cast “really meant a lot” to her because she feels “WAP” is a “big, important song” in her career.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJqaqpSeeqN50Z6tnpmcqHq1tMRmamavn6extHnSoZylpF2jsrex0WapmqhdlrO1sdFmrpqoXaeyrbHArJxo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
