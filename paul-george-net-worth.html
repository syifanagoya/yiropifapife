During this period, he started to establish himself as a skilled athlete.</p><p>Although he wasn't considered a major prospect by most universities across the nation, Paul had offers from Santa Clara University and Pepperdine University. He ultimately chose Fresno State because he thought that he would have more playing time. During his two-year stint at college, George made a name for himself with a number of impressive performances.

Next season, the Pacers lost once again in the playoffs, this time to the Miami Heat.</p><p>By the 2012-2013 season, Paul had been shifted from shooting guard to small forward. His defensive and offensive capabilities became an integral part of the Pacers' strategy from this point onward, and he gained the NBA Most Improved Player.
