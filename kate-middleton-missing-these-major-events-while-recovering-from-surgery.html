In the past, the Princess has marked the occasion by <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>visiting schools and meeting pupils</a> to talk to them candidly about mental health.</p><p id=eD4cvk1uQS- data-wc=24>However, Children's Mental Health Week falls in early February, so Kate will still very much be in the recovery process following her abdominal surgery.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/09a00f018e27-gettyimages-1491243231.jpg><h2>The BAFTAs</h2><p id=erJpUbW0UCr data-wc=31>Kate never disappoints whenever she graces the red carpet at the annual BAFTA awards. Just last year, she exuded pure Grecian glamour when she donned a <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>white Alexander McQueen one-shoulder gown</a>.</p><p id=e5maFgr35fA data-wc=45>The BAFTAs this year will take place on 18 February. The Princess typically attends the event arm-in-arm with her husband, Prince William. While it is unclear whether William, who is President of BAFTA, will attend this year, Kate's likely absence will most definitely be felt.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5629548d30dd-gettyimages-1467853836.jpg><h2>Commonwealth Day service</h2><p id=eQJ8LhNMEyn data-wc=28>Commonwealth Day is an annual event that happens on the second Monday in March each year, and sees people from all over the Commonwealth come together to celebrate.&nbsp;</p><p id=e7dUHSEFyqK data-wc=32>Understandably, this celebration marks a major event in the royal calendar, and Kate is reliably always in attendance. Last year, <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>the Princess joined King Charles</a> for his first Commonwealth Day as King.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/aa2477739b5c-gettyimages-1473478353.jpg><h2>St Patrick's Day parade</h2><p id=eWNtaI3_rnZ data-wc=56>Last year, William and Kate stepped out together for a joint engagement on St Patrick's Day, attending a parade with the Irish Guards. This occasion was a momentous one, given that it was <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>the first time Kate attended the parade</a> as the new Colonel of the regiment, a position that she took over from her husband.&nbsp;</p><p id=eH8lW62F8hm data-wc=33>The pair made emotional speeches and presented traditional sprigs of shamrock to officers and guardsmen. It is highly unlikely that Kate will be able to attend the event on March 17 this year.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ba62b4767dd6-gettyimages-1131209918.jpg><h2>Easter church service at Windsor</h2><p id=eHxvmNEb3dpm data-wc=26>Easter is very much a family affair for the royals, who come together to attend a church service at Windsor each year to mark the occasion.&nbsp;</p><p id=ezT084aSDYnA data-wc=29>While Kate will likely not be able to attend the church service this year, the event will be happening right on their doorstep in Windsor, at St George's Chapel.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/90c69cadd266-gettyimages-1481051525.jpg><p id=ejxoYDJwKJOM data-wc=32>The rest of the family are likely to make an appearance at the Easter celebrations, including King Charles, who himself is <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>undergoing surgery for an enlarged prostate</a>, and his wife Queen Camilla.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="factBoxTitleClass_f1xis0ve hm-heading">LOVE THE ROYALS?
