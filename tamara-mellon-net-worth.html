Mellon attended Heathfield School, a prestigious all-girls boarding school in Ascot, Berkshire.

During her tenure as an accessories editor, she gained valuable experience in styling and trend forecasting. The exposure to the world of luxury fashion during this time allowed her to recognize the potential in the high-end shoe market.</p><p>In 1996, Mellon co-founded Jimmy Choo Ltd with Malaysian cobbler Jimmy Choo. With her keen eye for design and Choo's exceptional craftsmanship, they created a luxury shoe brand that quickly gained a dedicated following among celebrities and fashion enthusiasts worldwide. Mellon's innovative approach to marketing, including securing high-profile clients and celebrity endorsements, catapulted the brand to global fame. The company expanded its product line to include handbags, accessories, and men's shoes under Mellon's leadership.</p><p>By 2001 the company had more than 100 wholesale clients that included Saks Fifth Avenue, Bergdorf Goodman, Harvey Nichols, and Harrods.

The new influx of capital helped to propel the brand's international expansion. In 2004, Jimmy Choo was sold again, this time to the private equity firm Lion Capital. Despite these changes in ownership, Mellon remained in her role as Chief Creative Officer and continued to guide the company's creative vision.</p><p>Jimmy Choo's success caught the attention of the luxury goods conglomerate Labelux Group, which acquired the company in 2011 for a reported Â£525 million.

The brand offers a range of high-quality shoes, handbags, and accessories, characterized by bold designs and innovative styles. One of the key differentiators of her new venture is the direct-to-consumer business model, which allows for greater control over pricing, design, and production.</p><p>Mellon has been open about the challenges she faced while launching her brand, including a high-profile bankruptcy in 2015. Despite the setback, she successfully restructured the business and has continued to grow her brand, focusing on customer-centricity and embracing the digital landscape.</p><p>In addition to her work in the fashion industry, Mellon has authored a memoir, "In My Shoes," published in 2013.
