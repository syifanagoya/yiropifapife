She emphasized that it meant a lot to her, especially now that she has a daughter, as it showed that anything is possible if you work hard.</p><p>“It means the world because when I started, there were so many things that I was told women would never be able to do,” Lynch said. “I was told, by one of my friends actually, when I told them that I wanted to main event WrestleMania, he said, ‘It’s nice to have dreams, but be realistic.’ It wasn’t a mean friend, it was just that that was the norm, that it was just seen as if women will never main event.</p><p>“So to be able to be the first woman to do it, to walk out of MetLife Stadium holding two championships, being Becky Two Belts, it’s a dream come true. But especially having a daughter, being able to show her anything is possible if you put your mind to it and work diligently towards it.”</p><p>Lynch elaborated in a tweet by stating, “Dream big. Nothing is impossible. I used to walk post Madison Square Garden every day after working in the city for a summer and that was my dream…to wrestle there. Turn your dreams into a reality and you’ll never be happier.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Dream big.
